# Pi-Assistant
A customizable speech controlled assistant built using a Raspberry Pi, utilizing Google Cloud Speech as a way to parse user voice commands and Rivescript as a way to react to them. 
Right now, this project is in the early stages, but progress on the overall command->response framework is being made. 
Eventually, I plan on setting my raspberry pi up with music options, lighting configurations, and more. The end result is basically a Google Home / Amazon Alexa that's more personalized and privacy focused.
